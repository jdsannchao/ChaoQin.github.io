## 👋 Hi, I'm Chao Qin

I recently completed my 4-year PhD at the College of Computing and Data Science [(CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing/home), Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
My research interests lie in **multimodal understanding**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large language model (LLM) applications**.

I am deeply grateful to my advisor, Nanyang Assoc. Prof. Li Boyang ["Albert"](http://boyangli.org/), for his constant support and guidance during my PhD.

I hold a B.Sc. in **Mathematics** from NTU, and an M.Sc. in **Business Analytics** from NUS. As I approach graduation, I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities with companies and teams that are passionate about **AI**, **data**, and **LLMs**.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and taking care of my cat.
You can find some of my travel photos and cute cat pictures in the [Hobbies](portfolio.html) section of this homepage.
